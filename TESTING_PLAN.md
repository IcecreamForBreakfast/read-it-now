# Testing Plan for Read-It-Later MVP

## Overview
This document outlines a comprehensive testing strategy for the Read-It-Later application to ensure reliability, prevent regressions, and maintain code quality as features are added.

## Current Architecture Analysis

### Backend Components (Node.js/Express)
- **Authentication**: Session-based auth with bcrypt password hashing
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Article Processing**: Web scraping with JSDOM
- **Auto-Tagging**: Rule-based content classification
- **API Routes**: RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations
- **Token System**: Personal tokens for iOS sharing

### Frontend Components (React/TypeScript)
- **Authentication**: Login/register flows with session management
- **Article Management**: CRUD operations with optimistic updates
- **Auto-Tagging**: Analytics dashboard and manual tag editing
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first interface
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state

## Historical Bug Analysis

### Recurring Issues (High Priority for Testing)
1. **Session Authentication Bugs** - Multiple session persistence issues
2. **Cookie Security Problems** - Cookie settings causing auth failures
3. **Article Content Parsing** - Paragraph formatting and blocked site handling
4. **Delete Operation Failures** - 404 handling and optimistic updates
5. **Missing API Endpoints** - Frontend calling non-existent backend routes
6. **URL Format Handling** - iOS shortcuts sending various URL formats
7. **Production vs Development** - Environment-specific configuration issues
8. **User Data Isolation** - Manual tag editing auth errors
