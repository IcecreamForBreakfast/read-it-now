Please read our disclosure policy.\n\nAuthentic Chimichurri is a traditional recipe from Uruguay & Argentina, where it’s a staple accompaniment to grilled meats, especially churrasco (grilled beef) at any asado (barbecue). Chimichurri is a vibrant, tangy, and herbaceous oil-based condiment that brings a burst of fresh flavors to any dish. The dominant notes come from fresh parsley, garlic, and oregano, giving it a bright and aromatic quality.\n\nThe originality of this recipe is fiercely debated, with many sites claiming theirs is the original. Amidst this dispute, I can proudly say my recipe was passed down from a special person—my dad, a born-and-bred Uruguayan and one of the best cooks I know. Dating back to his childhood in 1935, he cherished and honed this recipe for years, and shared it with me. It can’t get any more original than that! This recipe will always hold a special place in my heart.\n\nWhat Sets This Authentic Chimichurri Apart?\n\nAuthentic Chimichurri: Key Ingredients\n\nAdditions And Substitutions\n\nCreating Perfect Chimichurri: Step-By-Step\n\nAuthentic Chimichurri (Uruguay & Argentina) Recipe\n\nWhat Sets This Authentic Chimichurri Apart?\n\nThe magic of this Chimichurri recipe lies in its authenticity and the love infused in every step. With ingredients meticulously selected for their flavors and textures, this recipe offers a truly unique experience. What makes it stand out is the heartwarming story behind it, passed down through generations, bringing a piece of my family’s history to your table.\n\nLast week, my Dad, who has recently been diagnosed with late-stage cancer, shared chimichurri stories from his youth. Memories of barbecuing churrascos on HUGE old cast iron plates over open fire and playing street soccer after. No internet. No phones. A time of pure happiness amidst third-world poverty, a time he cherishes.\n\nIn that special moment, I rushed to the kitchen to recreate his version. With his guidance, I learned to start with less of the stronger ingredients (like garlic, salt, and chili) and gradually add more until reaching the perfect taste. There’s no hiding with chimichurri. Start small and add gradually.\n\nAuthentic Chimichurri: Key Ingredients\n\nThe secret to this Chimichurri recipe lies in its key ingredients. Fresh parsley, garlic, and oregano create a vibrant, flavorful sauce that elevates any grilled meat. Red wine vinegar and olive oil balance the tangy and rich flavors. Let’s dive into what makes this recipe truly exceptional:\n\nFresh Parsley: Opt for flat-leaf parsley over curly parsley, as it has a more robust flavor and tender texture. Look for vibrant green leaves without yellowing or wilting. Freshness is key, so choose bunches with crisp stems and aromatic leaves.\n\nGarlic: For the best flavor, use fresh garlic bulbs instead of pre-minced or powdered garlic. Look for firm, plump cloves without any signs of sprouting or softness. Fresh garlic will add a pungent and aromatic kick to your chimichurri.\n\nOregano: Fresh oregano is ideal, but dried oregano can also work well in chimichurri. If using fresh, select sprigs with bright green leaves and a strong, earthy aroma. If using dried, opt for high-quality oregano with a robust fragrance and deep color.\n\nOlive Oil: Use extra virgin olive oil for its superior taste and health benefits. Look for cold-pressed olive oil with a fruity and peppery flavor. The richness of the oil will carry the flavors of the herbs and garlic beautifully. Good quality olive oil is essential for any sauce, including this Homemade Pesto. It provides the backbone and is crucial to the final flavor.\n\nPro Tip: Every time I see a chimichurri recipe on the internet, I cringe because the ingredients are often tossed into a food processor and blended to a puree. What should be a loose, oil-based condiment becomes a herbed mash, more like baby food with your churrasco. No, no, no bueno. For an old-school chimichurri with authentic flavors, stay away from food processors.\n\n*Note: Please see Recipe Card at the bottom for a full list of ingredients and measurements.\n\nAdditions And Substitutions\n\nWhen it comes to Chimichurri, versatility is key. Even if you don’t have every ingredient on hand, don’t worry—there are plenty of tasty alternatives that will keep the flavors vibrant and authentic:\n\nFresh red chili is optional. We use a whole large chili, but you can use half or none at all. Substitute with 1-2 teaspoons of dried red chili flakes if you prefer.\n\nRed wine vinegar is the best for chimichurri. If you need a substitution, use lemon juice. We don’t recommend balsamic or white vinegar, as they alter the authentic flavor.\n\nCreating Perfect Chimichurri: Step-By-Step\n\nReady to create an authentic Chimichurri? Follow these simple steps with images to guide you through the process. You’ll achieve a vibrant, flavorful sauce with the fresh parsley, garlic, and oregano, balanced by tangy red wine vinegar and rich olive oil. This old-school chimichurri is sure to impress and delight:\n\nChop parsley, garlic, and red chilli: Finely chop the fresh parsley, garlic, and red chili. This ensures a vibrant and flavorful base for your chimichurri.\n\nMix in wet ingredients together in a bowl: Combine the chopped ingredients with olive oil, red wine vinegar, and oregano. Stir well to create a consistent sauce.\n\n*Pro Tip: If you like a strong garlic flavor, use 4 cloves. If you prefer milder garlic, start with 2 cloves, mix it all in, and allow it to sit for a few minutes. Then, taste test. If you’d like more, add more.\n\nLet it sit for at least 10 minutes (preferably 2 hours): Allow the chimichurri to sit so the flavors meld together. For the best results, let it sit for more than 2 hours.\n\nUse to baste meats while grilling or barbecuing: Brush chimichurri over chicken or steaks while grilling. Add a couple of tablespoons over your steak to serve. I prefer basting, but you can also use it as a marinade if desired.\n\nSo now, this heirloom is passed onto you to enhance any plate with my Chimichurri. Make good use of it and protect it jealously-my father would be so happy! If you’re looking for ideas to creatively use this versatile sauce, the sky’s the limit! Try substituting pesto with Chimichurri in our Pesto Grilled Chicken Avocado Salad, or sprinkle some on Crispy Garlic Roasted Potatoes. For a more traditional approach, baste it on Grilled Steak. Not Satisfied? Baste it on Lamb Chops or Juicy Oven Chicken Breasts.\n\nChimichurri can last in the fridge for about 1 week. Store it in an airtight container to maintain its freshness.\n\nWhile fresh herbs are best, you can use dried herbs in a pinch. Use half the amount of dried herbs as you would fresh.\n\nIt’s recommended to finely chop the ingredients by hand for the best texture. Using a food processor can turn the chimichurri into a puree, which is not ideal.\n\nThis recipe is a tribute to my Dad, who sadly passed away in May of 2024.\n\nEasy Homemade Focaccia\n\nHomemade Truffle Fries\n\nSubscribe to Cafe Delites FOR FREE and receive recipes straight into your inbox!\n\nAuthentic Chimichurri (Uruguay & Argentina)\n\nIngredients USMetric 1x2x3x\n\n▢ 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar\n\n▢ 1/2 cup parsley finely chopped\n\n▢ 3-4 cloves garlic finely chopped or minced\n\n▢ 2 red chilies small, or 1 red chili, deseeded and finely chopped (about 1 tablespoon finely chopped chili)\n\n▢ 3/4 teaspoon dried oregano\n\n▢ 1 teaspoon coarse salt level\n\n▢ 1/2 teaspoon pepper to taste (about 1/2 teaspoon)\n\nMix all ingredients together in a bowl.
