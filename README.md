# Read It Now

A simple read-it-later web app that helps me save articles and organize them as work or personal. Lightweight, clean, and built to be actually usable — not just a toy project.

## What it does

- Save articles or links to read later  
- Multi-user support with authentication  
- Clean, distraction-free reader view  
- Tag-based filtering to quickly find what you need  
- Cloud sync across devices using Supabase  

## Why I built it

I'm a former software engineer turned PM, picking up coding again after ~20 years. This app is a practical portfolio piece- a way to vibe-code something useful.

## How to use it

Paste a link or save an article to your list.  
Filter by tags and read distraction-free whenever you’re ready.  
(Soon, it’ll auto-tag new items as *work* or *personal* — coming soon.)

## Tech stack

- React with TypeScript (frontend)  
- Vite as the build tool  
- Tailwind CSS for styling  
- Supabase for database and auth  
- Node.js environment with npm  

## What’s next

- Push to production  
- Add auto-tagging  
- Clean up the user experience
